This is my solution to the Codecademy Games of Chance Challenge Project for Python!

It may not be the most elegant solution... I'm new to Python and still learning.

I tried to factor in errors and make sure it prints with each call of the game functions and updates the global money variable to make user interaction easier.

My guess is that there are probably simpler logic flows for these functions, so I'd like to revisit it with some better solutions later, after learning more Python!
